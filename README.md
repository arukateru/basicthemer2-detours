# basicthemer2-detours
Both applies basic theme and makes apps behave as if DWM was off. If you aren't extremely familiar with DWM and basic theme, you might think that these 2 statements mean the same thing. They both cause the basic theme to be applied to the program's titlebar or border. However, some programs behave differently when DWM is off, most notably apps with "extended client area", which include mspaint and wordpad. When using the normal BasicThemer2, your only options are to exclude these options or to deal with having a very buggy (transparent or all black, not responsive) titlebar. However, using BasicThemer2-detours causes these apps to have a normal working Aero Basic titlebar with DWM enabled. Most importantly of all, it allows you to get Aero Basic navigation bar, which at the moment I believe it is impossible (at least in LTSC 2019 aka 1809 msstyles, the color for the navigation bar and the left pane whatever it's called share the same color). It's not perfect. For example you will have to make Edge or Chrome apply the legacy buttons, which you can see in the screenshot below. The easiest way to do that is by using this theme: which fits nicely with Aero Basic: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/windows-vista-basic-theme/bkohfcingfpclphbaglfbbjbfajcepad By the way, most credit for this program goes to Ingan121 of course for making the original BasicThemer2 and Splitwirez for the detours version. However unfortunately, Splitwirez' repository was privated or removed. So here it's, maybe I can make improvements to it in the future. Here is also a compiled version
